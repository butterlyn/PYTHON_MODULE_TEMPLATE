# PYTHON_MODULE_TEMPLATE
> Template and instructions for uploading python code to PyPI as a module package.

Use the directory /[[PROJECT-NAME]] as a template for uploading python code to PyPI as a module that can be downloaded by others using pip and imported to other python programs.

Follow the instructions in [INSTALLATION](##INSTALLATION:) to install jupyter, then run [setup.ipynb](setup.ipynb) using jupyter. [setup.ipynb](setup.ipynb) contains full instructions for configuring /[[PROJECT-NAME]] as required.
